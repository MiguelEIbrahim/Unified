This is a HTML and PHP code for a web page that displays a list of restaurants. Here is an explanation of the code:

    The first line declares the document type as HTML.
    The <html> tag defines the beginning and end of the HTML document, with the "lang" attribute set to "en" to specify the language.
    The <head> section contains metadata about the document, including a link to the website icon, a link to the stylesheet, and the page title.
    The <body> section contains the content of the page.
    The PHP code starting with <?php and ending with ?> is used to execute PHP code in the middle of HTML code. In this case, it is used to fetch restaurant data from a MySQL database.
    The code then loads a navigation bar using the loadNavBar() function defined in another PHP file.
    The radio buttons and labels are used for filtering the restaurants based on their category, with the "All" option selected by default.
    The try block connects to the MySQL database using PDO and executes a SQL query to fetch restaurant data. The results are stored in an associative array called $result.
    The PHP foreach loop is used to iterate over the $result array and display the data for each restaurant in an <li> element. This includes the restaurant name, rating, number of ratings, and type.
    The data-category attribute is used to assign a category to each restaurant, which is used for filtering later.
    The JavaScript code at the end of the file is used for implementing the search bar and the content security policy for the page.
    The code ends with the </html> tag to signify the end of the HTML document.
