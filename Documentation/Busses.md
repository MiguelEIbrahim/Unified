This code is an HTML page that displays a map of bus routes in Lebanon using the Leaflet library. The map displays the routes as polylines, and each route is highlighted when selected from a dropdown menu.

The code also includes a legend that displays the color codes for each bus route.

The meta tag in the head section sets the content security policy for the page to restrict the resources that can be loaded, such as scripts and stylesheets, to only those from certain sources. This is a security feature that helps prevent cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks.

The script tags in the head section loads the Font Awesome library for icons and sets the content security policy for the page.

The link tags in the head section load the Leaflet CSS stylesheet, a custom CSS stylesheet for the bus routes map, and the page icon.

The body section includes a PHP script that loads the page's navbar.

The script tags at the bottom of the page load the Leaflet library, a JSON file containing the bus route data, and two custom JavaScript files. The app.js file contains code for creating and updating the bus route dropdown menu and highlighting selected routes on the map. The SearchBar.min.js file likely provides functionality for a search bar, although this code snippet does not include it.

Overall, this code creates an interactive map of bus routes in Lebanon, allowing users to select and view individual routes and their corresponding color codes.
